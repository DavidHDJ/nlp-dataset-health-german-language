# Purpose and characteristics of the data set
- Provide "social media"-like natural language data for training classification models in digital health sector
- Reason why: There are only little data sets publicly available that cover both German language and health topics
- Each record in the text data is labelled as follows: 1=sentence is health related, 0=sentence is not health related
- "'Social media'-like" means that you can expect rather short sentences, misspelled words, missing punctuation etc.
